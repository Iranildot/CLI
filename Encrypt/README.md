# ENCRYPT

Program written in C that encrypts and decrypts texts typed in the CLI. It has been based on CS50 project.

# HOW TO USE IT?

1. Grab the code copying and pasting it where you want (into a **.c** file);
2. Open a terminal window where you have saved the file and then type **clang -o program_name program_name.c**;
3. After that, execute **./program_name** to run the program (The first time it will print out a error message becuse you do not have **key.c** file, where the key will be stored). This step will creat a random key you are going to use to encript and decript messages;
4. Execute **./program_name** again and you will see the message **Do you want ENCRYPT (1), DECRYPT (2), SEE KEY (3), CHANGE KEY (4) OR QUIT (5)?**. This is a CLI menu where you can navigate through.
5. Right now you can enjoy the program.
